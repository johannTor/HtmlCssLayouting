# HtmlCssLayouting

I decided to remake a poster about a 1 million dollar tournament in the video game Quake Champions that was posted
online back in 2017. The poster seemed simple enough to recreate but it surprised me how much of a hastle it actually was getting all the elements in their correct places. I decided to use css grids for the main content and I had to position the images absolutely within the container that has relative position in order to get them in the right places. To position the footer logos in the center
I used floats.

The original poster is in the repository called PosterGoal.jpg
